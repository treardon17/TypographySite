        <p>Today's font choice is from Brooklyn based graphic designer Christopher J Lee. Canter is an all caps, condensed typeface available in five different weights, designed as a display type for titles, headlines, and posters.  Lee says, &quot;This was my first attempt using FontLab Studio, so please bear with me! All of the Canter weights are ready for download, just ask if you want a copy.&quot; If this is what he can create for his first attempt, we can't wait to see what he comes up with next.</p>
